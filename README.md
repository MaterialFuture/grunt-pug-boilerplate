# Pug Grunt Boilerplate

This is, as the name suggests, a Boilerplate template for the Pug/Jade html templating, and the grunt task runner for automating tasks and such. This is what I use personally for getting up and running faster when there's an exsisting backend to host and serve content (FTP).
I chose grunt over other task runners not just because I was more familiar with it, but more so that I found it easier to plug and play with new features. I chose pug (within grunt) because you can create templates and mixins to make building pages faster. I'll go over how I develop pages within grunt from the ground up so that it's easier to jump in and get started.

## Setting up

- Open the command-line, `âŒ˜ + Space` Then type `Terminal`
- Download or clone the Git Repo `git clone <git ssh url>`.
- Go into directory `cd <repo name>`.
- Run `npm install` to install everything.
- After everything is done run the grunt task runner and start editing `atom . && grunt` or `subl . && grunt` if you're working with sublime.

#### Easy Mode

One line version if you don't care about what everything does `git clone <git ssh url> && cd <name> && npm install && grunt` Paste in console where you'd like the directory copied.

## Getting started with Grunt

By running the command `grunt` you start a local server through browserSync as well as a watch command so that Grunt can watch files for changes, run the appropriate task according to what's changed, and then serve it locally. If you take a look at `gruntfile.js` you can find all the tasks and understand all that's going on. Here are some of the tasks:

- watch
- browser-sync
- sassjs
- postcss
- newer
- concat
- uglify
- eslint
- htmlmin
- html
- pug

If you don't understand what's going on with Grunt then check out the docs for this: <https://gruntjs.com/getting-started>


## Getting started with Pug

Grunt will take care of the compiling work so you can just focusing on working on your project and grunt will watch for changes and output into the `/dist` directory.


## _Nightwatch Tests_

WIP

## _Pug Structure_

Start developing by creating your file structure in the `/pug` directory. After setting that up, put the files you're actively developing in the gruntfile under the pug section, that way when a change is saved, grunt will know what to render into html.
Same goes for CSS and JS, just create the file structure in the proper directory, setup in Grunt, then develop and it'll render what you need.


## _WIP_

- Replacing NPM with Yarn for smaller directory size and for less dependancies.
- Setup proper SASS and CSS folders and files.
- Possibly include Image folder with automated image compression or link to project in README file.


##  _Collaborating_
### 1\. Clone your fork:

```
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-FORKED-REPO.git
```


### 2\. Add remote from original repository in your forked repository:

```
cd into/cloned/fork-repo
git remote add upstream git://github.com/ORIGINAL-DEV-USERNAME/REPO-YOU-FORKED-FROM.git
git fetch upstream
```

### 3\. Updating your fork from original repo to keep up with their changes:

```
git pull upstream master
```

### 4\. Developing

Setup your npm env: `npm install`
Grunt will handle all the things you need for developing. Run grunt by using: `grunt -v`
